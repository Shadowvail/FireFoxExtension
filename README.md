# FireFoxExtension

This extension is used in conjunction with eBay search filtering in order to alert a user of a found item. The way it works is the following.

The user creates a filtered search in eBay and opens the search to display the results. In most cases, there will be no results for a very specific search. The page is then reloaded on a timer to check for new results. If a result is found, the extension alerts the user of a result and automatically moves to the tab that found the result. The user can then purchase the found item if it matches meets their needs.

The main purpose of this extension is that it aids the user in finding listed items at the very moment that they are posted. Potentially great deals can be found and purchased before other users can find and purchase the item. 

This extension DOES NOT automatically purchase anything. It simply alerts the user of a found search result. The purchasing of the item is still manually done by the user.
